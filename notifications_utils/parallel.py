def control_chunk_and_worker_size(data_size=None, chunk_size=None, max_workers=None):
    """Attempts to optimize the chunk size and number of workers based on the size of the data to be processed. The following rules are applied:
    - Max concurrently allowed workers is the number of CPU cores
    - 1 worker is used when data sets <= 1000
    - Chunk sizes are capped at 10,000 and are calculated with: `data_size / max_chunk_size`
    - For chunk sizes < 10,000 worker counts are scaled up
    - For chunk sizes that would be >= 10,000 the concurrent workers scale down to 5 to limit CPU context switching

    Args:
        data_size (int, optional): Size of the iterable being chunked. Defaults to 40000.
        chunk_size (int, optional): Overrides default chunk_size of 10000. Defaults to None.
        max_workers (int, optional): Overrides default max workers of 10. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        tuple[int, int]: The optimized chunk size and number of workers to execute in parallel.
